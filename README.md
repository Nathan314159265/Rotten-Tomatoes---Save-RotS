# Rotten-Tomatoes---Save-RotS
A bot to help r/PrequelMemes fight the opposing bots that are plaguing the Rotten Tomatoes poll.




u/abrahammurciano wrote a script to constantly upvote all the star wars films on Rotten Tomatoes Summer Movie Showdown. We need everyone to run the script constantly so we can counter the other side's upvotes.

The script can be found here.

Instructions to join the efforts:

⁠Install a browser extension to run scripts if you dont have one already. Options include:

• ⁠User JavaScript and CSS (Chrome) (Recommended. These instructions assume you're using this.) • ⁠Tampermonkey (Chrome) • ⁠Tampermonkey (Firefox)

⁠Go to the Rotten Tomatoes voting site.

⁠Click the extension that you installed in step 1.

⁠Click 'Add New' to add the script for that page.

⁠At the top, where it shows the website that the script will run on, put the link to the voting site (https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/summer-movie-showdown/).

⁠Go to my script (the javascript file) and copy all the code.

⁠Paste it into the JavaScript section of the extension (the left panel, where it says JS or JavaScript).

⁠Make sure the script is enabled and jQuery is enabled in options (top right corner) and save the code in the extension.

⁠Done! Reload the Rotten Tomatoes page, and watch it do its magic (it will constantly reload and upvote). Just keep the Rotten Tomatoes tab open.

At last we will have our revenge!
